Want to add a cute and adorable personified entity to your AI project? YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE! From the makers of the highly popular toy BB-8 comes Maslo... an animated expressive empathetic entity. Use Maslo on a website, mobile phone, or anywhere you'd like.

## Persona Module

You can think of the persona as the companion's ‘face’. This is a mathematically expressed amorphous shape. This shape consists of multiple properties (ie: size, speed, brightness, complexity, color, etc) that change based on user inputs and interaction. Every user can have a unique persona and their persona will evolve over time.

## Persona Reactions

Each persona will react to the user inputs through animations that include visual changes, sound, color, and haptic feedback. You can play with the reactions here: (https://heymaslo.github.io/maslo-persona-2d/)
The types of reactions described below:

* State Reaction: A reaction is a particular audiovisual response from the persona.
* Dynamic Idle: An anthropomorphised animation based on average of computed sentiment.

## Install & Run

1. Install Node.js & NPM ( * If not installed )
2. Run in project root:

    ```bash
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

3. Browse to http://localhost:8080

## Structure

1. `lib` – here lives ES6 classes with meaningful JSDoc comments for Maslo Persona core code. Not ready for rendering, requires further integration to a rendering scene, but all core logic is placed here including usage of Three.js, gsap, mobx.
2. `web` – a HTML/WebGL renderer for Maslo Persona that is ready to be placed right in HTML project with minimal additional configuration.
3. `webdemo` – basically the only runnable (and main for now) guy here, single page site based on webpack dev server that uses `web` package for Persona rendering.
4. [TODO]  `react-native` – renderer for RN

## How To Use

Maslo Persona is available for usage only in Web environment for now. React Native adapter is on its way.

You can check out `webdemo` sub-package to see how it has been used for web demo. All environment-specific stuff is configured there.

General notes are the following:

* The sources use ES6 and some extra features like decorators. It is intended to be build with Babel. Appropriate configuration can be hooked up from `webdemo/babel.config.js`.
* `require`'s across files are used with `webpack` in mind, but without aliases.
* `web` sub-package sets up persona in Web ennvironment, but not runnable itself.

To instantiate and manipulate Maslo Persona:

```javascript
import { Persona, States } from '@heymaslo/persona/web';

/* ... */
const targetElement = document.body.querySelector('#main');

// Web Renderer will use `targetElement` as container for WebGL canvas
const persona = new Persona({
    // target HTML container that will hold WebGL canvas
    element: this.element,

    // size of the canvas, in pixels. Recommended is `persona.radius` multiplied by 3
    size: 900,

    persona: {
        // amount of vertices per ring. Bigger value increases quality, smaller increases performance
        ringRes: 100,

        // radius of Persona view, in pixels
        radius: 300,
    },
});

// run auto updates
persona.run();
// stop/pause
persona.stop();

// or manually update it every frame
persona.step();

// resize – react to screen dimensions changes (not really required by now, but may be so in future)
persona.resize();

// Working with Persona itself:

const currentState = persona.core.state; // gets current persona state, observable via MobX
persona.core.setState(States.Hey); // sets new state

// Run prolongated state. For now only "listen" is supported.
persona.core.beginState(States.Listen);
persona.core.endState();

// Update Persona mood moficators (0..1)
persona.core.mood.joy = 1.0;
```

All functions' parameters are documented via JSDoc, including available states and mood modificators. But, for the sake of this Readme completeness, here they are:

```javascript
States = "joy" | "surprise" | "listen" | "init" | "idle" | "upset" | "yes" | "no" | "hey" | "shake" | "tap" | "question";
Moods = "joy" | "love" | "surprise" | "terror" | "anger" | "sadness" | "sleepy" | "calm";
```

### Resources

All resources for Persona are located in `lib/assets` folder. They're `require`d using `webpack` style, and output for images & audios are URL, and for shaders are just raw strings. Corresponding `webpack` loaders are configured in `webdemo/webpack.config.js`. But if you don't want to use `webpack`, you should provide those URLs and shaders strings manually to Persona configuration:

```javascript
new MasloPersona({
    // add this block to Persona's configuration. JSDoc (at least in VSCode) should be able to provide info about this argument shape
    resources: {
        textures: {
            noise: { url: 'url/to/noise.png' },
        },
        audio: {
            hey: { url: '/assets/audio/hey.mp3' },
            /* ... */
        },
        shaders: {
            PersonaFragment: { raw: '<shader raw sources>' },
            /* ... */
        },
    },
});
```
